            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>A MEMORIAL FOR THE Poor French Refugeesâ–ª</head>
            <p>WE the Poor <hi>French</hi> Ministers, Gentlemen and others, distressed <hi>Refugees</hi> now in <hi>England,</hi> with the deepest and fullest sense of Gratitude, in the first place return to Your Honours our humble and just Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, for Your most Christian and Charitable Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of us the last Year, by which opportune Relief we have been preserv'd from Perishing under those many Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>series which then oppressed us.</p>
            <p>Nor is it possible for us ever to forget the great Obligations this Generous and Charitable House as laid us under, in so Kindly receiving, and so Charitably Relieving us hitherto.</p>
            <p>'Tis this that fills us with the utmost Confusion, in still presuming to trouble Your Honours; but being incouraged by Your Honours experienced Commiseration, and forcibly pressed by our crying Necessities, we humbly crave leave to implore the continuance of Your Honours Charitable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for us, without which Your former Goodness will prove ineffectual, and we your distressed Suppliants, with our poor Families, must be inevitably exposed to the utmost ruine and destruction.</p>
            <p>Therefore they humbly crave leave again to represent to this Honourable House of Commons, that although Your Honours intention was to grant unto the poor <hi>French Refugees</hi> for their relief the last Year 15000 <hi>l.</hi> The said <hi>Refugees</hi> having been Pay'd in Tallies, upon which they did lose a great deal, they have received but about one half of it. So they are in hope Your Honours this Year will be pleased to take into your Consideration their great Lose, and to grant unto this poor People, to rescue them from their ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Misery, the Sum of 20000 <hi>l.</hi> without which they are in danger to be brought into Prison, and there to Starve and Perish miserably.</p>
